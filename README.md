statically typed:
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time.
 the programmer must specify what type each variable is (e.g.: Java, C, C++);
 he main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler
 bugs can be easily found.
 statically typed programming languages do type checking at compile-time as opposed to run-time.
 Examples of statically typed languages are :- Java, C, C++
 
 dinamically typed:
 A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc.
 This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time
 Dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run-time as opposed to compile-time.
 bugs cannot be found easily
 quicker than statically typed
 Examples of dynamically typed languages are :- Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript
 
b. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17253545/scripting-language-vs-programming-language

 scripting language:
 Scripting languages are programming languages that don't require an explicit compilation step.
 you can run the code directly without compiling it
 it will be quicker process 
 Lua,JavaScript,VBScript and VBA Perl


programming languages:
Programming Language : Is compiled to machine code and run on the hardware 
it should be compiled first before run .
it takes time comapred to scripting language
 C, C++, Haskell
 
2. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. but , HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
HTTP/2 is faster in terms of performance and site loading time than HTTP1.
HTTP/2 is the second major version of the HTTP network protocol. HTTP/2 is now used by 50% of all websites
